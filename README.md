A database is an organised collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from
a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal
design and modeling techniques.The database management system (DBMS) is the software that
interacts with end users, applications, the database itself to capture and analyse the data and
provides facilities to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the
associated applications can be referred to as a "database system". Often the term "database" is
also used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated
with the database.
